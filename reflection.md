This project emphasize on arrays which is very different to my other projects so it was interesting to work on something new. Arrays were used to keep track of the patterns of simon says and to predict what will or won'tt happen. We used variables to emphasize what part of the floor it was. This project went back to the simple parts of coding that we learned but it was a good refresher to help execute our skills.
