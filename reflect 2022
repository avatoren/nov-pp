Ellee: In this project, I used variables to draw the floor and create tiles through vectors. For tiles and the grid, I mapped out their sturtcure and colors with using points on the turtle grid. I also stored patterns and guessses in an array and further used functions to implement their use. I additionally used conditionals in deturmining the tile pattern wiht the amount of guesses. Overall I really enjoyed coding this project and expiramenting with errors such as they pattern and the user interaction not working properly.
