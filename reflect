Ellee: Ava and I worked on this projet together with the help of my mentor.
I was proud of how I  barely used starter code to complete my project especially with importing the complex turtle and fucntions
as i ran my project a few errors appeared and after a day of trying to figure whats wrong, ava and I worked through these problems and we figured out why the board was incorecctly being printed
In the future, I will continue to brainstorm ideas and execute them hopefully to the point where i need absuletly no help constructing the code. 
A challenge I faced was brainstormign where to start with coding this. But after talking to Ava and having more dieas to work from we figured it out. 


Ava: I chose to work on this project with Ellee for this month. We took the idea of the Simon Game and made it our own. You have to follow the pattern of the boxes that light up. My part of the project was to draw the grid- so i chose the colors and the location of the squares. After I completed that, Ellee worked on the project a little and then i worked on the tapping of the squares to make the color of them dim. This is the second project Ellee and I worked on together and we did a much better job working together on this than the last one.
